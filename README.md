#About Lab Tools#
This repo is designed to be a swiss army knife for all lab needs when dealing in offensive security,
for the sake of testing defense systems for proper alert/prevention engineering rules, and overall technical 
product testing to really trigger alerts in great systems accross windows based environments.

Originally developed for use by the Technical Product Enablement team at Palo Alto Networks for Cortex testing, 
the LOTL style incorporated in the Powershell commands will prove suitable for all Windows lab environments 
suited to test the same goals.

As far as the sophistication of the tools themselves, this shouldn't be looked at as an all encompassing 
red team tool set, since true red team seeks to bypass known defenses with unconventional methods. 

Instead, this tool kit befits security testers who wish to trigger alerts in their Defense architecture 
to properly test defensive engineering rules/policies for the sake of embettering their defensive landscapes.

For those just learning the feild, it's a great tool kit to start testing intermediate level red-teaming operations, since 
it's use case oriented, and was developed in the wild and on the run while testing different attack scenarios in Enterprise 
lab settings to trigger alerts accross Early Availability Cortex Products.
